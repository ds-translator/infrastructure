# Infrastructure with Terraform/Terragrunt

This repo contains the parameterized AWS infrastructure with EKS cluster and nodegroups.

We use Terragrunt to deploy DRY to dev-, prod- and stage-environments.

How to use:

1. Apply the creation of DevOps-group and users and IAM role for cluster administration.
2. Apply the infrastructure in dev/stage/prod
